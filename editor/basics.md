# Basics

When creating a new project, it is recommended to go through the "Guided Tour" to learn the basics of using the PaperVision editor. Click on the "Guided Tour" button when the welcome dialog comes up;

We'll go through some key points that are mentioned on the Guided Tour here;

## Input and Output Nodes

The initial two nodes when creating a new project serve as the starting point for your pipeline. The "Pipeline Input" feeds your algorithm with the images from the real-world, ready to be broken down into the steps needed to perform the detection you need.

While editing, you can choose various "Input Sources" to feed your pipeline with, for ease of use. You can use any USB webcam plugged into your computer, images, videos, and HTTP stream sources !

The "Pipeline Output", as the name implies, helps you being able to visualize the result of your processing. Any image passed onto the output parameter will be promptly displayed when previewing the pipeline.
